/* To add new resource entries, make a new dict-like entry like the one below:
{
    "Name": "Parris",
    "Description": "Parris, the automated infrastructure setup tool for machine learning algorithms.",
    "Link": "https://github.com/jgreenemi/Parris",
    "Keywords": "Python, AWS",
    "LastUpdatedDate": "2018/01/28",
},

Note:
- LastUpdatedDate does not get used in the engine, just helps to keep track of when entries were last changed.
- Keywords is a string, not a list. Commas are encouraged for readability but not required.
- Please only link to the original repository or the resource's original website, not a blog post or other middle-man page.
- Entries are displayed in the order they were added to the list. In the future I may introduce logic to do some other sorting (i.e. by LastUpdatedDate) but this will depend on what the community finds useful.

MLPleaseHelp is a simple ML resource search engine.

## How To Use ##

**This has not yet been made into a hosted page, that'll be set up soon. In the meantime you can run a local build.**

## Building Locally ##

In the same directory as the `index.html` page, open a terminal and start an HTTP server:

```bash
$ python -m http.server
```

Now open your web browser and off you go!

## Contributing ##

You can contribute resources to this repo! All the entries are a static list in `js/ml-assets.js`, so making new entries is as easy as adding a name, description, link and some keywords, then opening a Pull Request.
